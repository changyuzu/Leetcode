/*For any integer x, adding the negative value of x makes the sum add up to 0Put as an equation,  x + (-x) = 0So for any value n given in the problem, we can keep adding numbers that negate each other, starting from 1 to half of nIf n is an odd number, that means we'll need another digit other than the negating numbers, so we just add 0*/class Solution {public:    vector<int> sumZero(int n) {        vector<int> ans;        if (n%2 == 1) ans.push_back(0);        for (int i=1; i<=n/2; i++)        {            ans.push_back(i);            ans.push_back(-i);        }        return ans;    }};
